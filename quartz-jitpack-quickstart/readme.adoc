This is a quickstart example for Quartz Scheduler.

We will use https://jitpack.io/#zemian/quartz as Maven repository.

Sometimes the Official Quartz release is slow and they might not publish
quick enough for you to test out a build. The zemian's JitPack repository
provide immediate snapshot and pre-release for Quartz

For official tags, it should provide equivalent binary.

NOTE: Only `quartz-2.3.1` or higher is able to build from a plain vanilla JitPack server. 
Older releases requires "svn" commands that fails to build in that env.
